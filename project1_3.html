    <h1>My Favorite Author</h1>
    <p>My favorite author is Stephen King, a well-known horror writer. He has been
    writing since the early 1970's, and is still writing books today. He is perhaps
    the most famous horror writer of all-time, apart from H.P. Lovecraft, whom I have
    never read.</p>
    <p>The first Stephen King book that I read was "The Shining," which was his second
    book, and was made famous by the Stanley Kubrick film. Unfortunately, the film
    greatly deviates from the novel, and was turned into more of an artistic film.</p>
    <p>I have read approximately twenty of Stephen King's books, from the tiny novel
    "Carrie" all the way to the gigantic "The Stand." I have many more books to read, as
    he has published fifty novels and two-hundred short stories.</p>
