    <h1>My Favorite Genre</h1>
    <p>My favorite genre to read is horror. As there are not nearly the same amount
    of genres fror books are there are for movies or television shows, it is harder
    to pick a genre that you enjoy.</p>
    <p>Horror is my favorite genre because it seems more grounded than the other genres.
    Sci-fi novels are too far-fetched to be taken seriously, and romance novels are
    just as cheesy. Horror, however, is somewhat more realistic than the others. Also,
    I enjoy being scared once in a while.</p>
    <p>If there are any good horror authors, or other genres, that you might want to
    recommend, email me using the following link:</p>
