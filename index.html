    <h1>Reading</h1>
	<p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading. The first thing that I want to do
    when I come home from classes is to sit down and start reading. In fact, most of
    my weekend is spent reading. It serves as a way of relieving stress.</p>
    <p>I would say that I am a fast reader. However, when I read for pleasure, I like
    to take my time. I often reread sentences or paragraphs if I feel that I have
    missing something. Reading in this manner allows me to fully enjoy the books.</p>
    <p>I am known for taking very good care of my books. Although I have a Kindle with
    many e-books, I prefer reading an actual book rather than reading off of a screen.
    However, e-books are much cheaper than their physical counterparts, so eventually
    I will switch to solely e-books.</p>
